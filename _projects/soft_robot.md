Soft robots, as the name suggests, are made with soft materials rather than rigid ones.
These soft robots will bend, deform, and buckle upon contact rather than simply smashing on through whatever is in their way, resulting in a natural compliance that allows them to interact safely with the environment and around humans.
This compliance can also lead to robust behavior; think about how soft grippers have far more success wrapping themselves around objects to securely pick up objects compared to rigid pinch grasps.

Howevever, this compliant behavior is hard to model and thus planning for soft robots is a challenge.
If this behavior can be understood and exploited, we can gain the best of both worlds: safe, compliant interaction with robust long-horizon reasoning.

This work is done in collaboration with the [Robust and Adaptive Design (RAAD) Lab in Purdue Mechanical Engineering](https://purdueraadlab.wixsite.com/website-1).
