Modern robots are complex computer systems involving enormous amounts of software to handle everything from drivers to communicate to physical interfaces, middleware to communicate between disparate processes, and machine learning kernels to process incoming data to make decisions in real-time.
Robots' unique challenges (heterogeneous hardware, programmed and learned components, handling physical environments, emergent behavior in the real world, etc.) merit special consideration from the software used by practitioners and researchers.
Developing software components, libraries, and robot systems requires understanding and shaping code around these distinguishing use cases.
