Humans are hard to model and predict; thus, it is hard for a robot to consider how other people in the environment may act in its decision-making process. Finding efficient and effective ways to model human behavior to maintain the safety of people around a robot or to allow a robot to fluently collaborate with other people (or perhaps even other agents) is critical to deploying robots outside controlled environments such as the lab or factory.

Moreover, as robots become more capable agents and enter the real world, systems today appear in the workplace, home, and public spaces.
Ethical considerations of how robots *should* operate are trailing behind algorithmic advances, and these advances do not necessarily consider the other people the robot is working around explicitly.
Suppose the algorithms that control a robot's behavior are agnostic to human concerns. In that case, they will be (un)intentionally exploited by malicious, unethical, or ignorant actors to violate privacy, injure and disturb people, and further increase inequity.
