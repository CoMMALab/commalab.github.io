Time and tide wait for no one.

In the real world, people and objects will move around the environment, the world will change, and a robot cannot stay stationary and wait, scratching its head to think of what to do.
It is essential for critical robotics algorithms that guarantee safety and liveness (*i.e.*, will be able to reach the goal) to be able to *react* immediately to changing circumstances.
Autonomous cars must make decisions that determine the safety of their passengers and the world around them, mobile manipulators working in a factory or a warehouse may need to dodge unseen people and obstacles, and surgical robots must maintain patient safety at all times.

Algorithms that provide real-time performance can come through theoretical properties (guaranteeing a solution in a fixed amount of computation) or software/hardware engineering (using implementation or platform-specific features to accelerate algorithms).
