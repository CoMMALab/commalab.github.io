Multi-robot systems can do more than single robots through coordination and collaboration.
Planning for teams introduces challenges in scalability, as the joint configuration space grows exponentially with the number of robots, and in handling interactions between robots that must share workspace, coordinate actions, or physically collaborate on tasks.

Effective multi-robot planning requires reasoning about dependencies between robots' motions and managing computational complexity.
Applications include warehouse automation with fleets of mobile robots and collaborative manipulation where multiple arms transport objects together, requiring task-level coordination.
