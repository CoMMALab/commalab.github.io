Robots must learn from experience and data to be efficient in unmodeled, unknown, and previously unseen domains.
There are many methods for learning implicit models of the world, which capture everything from a 3D reconstruction of a scene, quantifying the risk of collision, understanding task constraints from human demonstrations, and more.
There are endless opportunities for integrating these models within existing algorithm frameworks or new neurosymbolic approaches to generalize planning capabilities to previously considered intractable problems.
