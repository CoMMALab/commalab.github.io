I am a Visiting Scholar in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in the CoMMA Lab.
I completed my master's degree with [Dr. Nina Mahmoudian](https://engineering.purdue.edu/mahmoudian) in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in West Lafayette, Indiana, studying autonomous underwater docking for AUVs.
My research interests lie in the intersection of task and motion planning, AI and computer vision.
