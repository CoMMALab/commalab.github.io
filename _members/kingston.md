I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I lead the CoMMA Lab.
I completed my master's, doctoral, and postdoctoral studies with [Dr. Lydia Kavraki](https://kavrakilab.org/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, Texas, studying manifold-constrained motion planning and long-horizon multi-modal motion planning.
Throughout my Ph.D. studies, I was funded by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship and worked with the Robonaut 2 team within the Dexterous Robotics Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center.

I am an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters under Planning and Simulation and the current maintainer of the [Open Motion Planning Library](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/), an open-source library with standard implementations of state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planners.

My research interests broadly encompass algorithms, methods, and software for high-dimensional robot (i.e., robots with many joints) decision-making and motion planning: how to make a robot achieve a complex task with many constraints quickly and efficiently?
