I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by Professor [Zachary Kingston](https://commalab.org/members/kingston/) in the [CoMMA Lab](https://commalab.org/).

Before joining Purdue, I completed my B.S. at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Michigan. I later earned my M.S. at the University of Michigan, where I worked in the [ROAHM Lab](http://www.roahmlab.com) under the supervision of Professor [Ram Vasudevan](http://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal).

My research focuses on safe (multi-)robot motion planning and, more broadly, on combining model-based methods with learning-enabled components so that robots can carry out a range of tasks such as manipulation safely and efficiently.
