Hey! I'm a MS student in CoMMA lab @ Purdue. I'm still exploring my research interests. Currently interested in behavioral cloning and creating general purpose manipulation policies.

In the past, I have worked on Physics-informed Motion Planning, Code-as-Policies, and dabbled with a bit of RL and vision.

Always feel free to reach out / shoot a message!
