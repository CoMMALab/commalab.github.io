I am an incoming  PhD student at CoMMA Lab, advised by Dr Zachary Kingston. I intend to work on Task and Motion Planning problems. I worked at [Aurora Inc](https://aurora.tech/) for 2 years before this, developing perception systems for the self-driving truck stack. Prior to this, I did my masters at UC San Diego, with a thesis on Affordance based task planning under [Prof. Henrik Christensen](https://hichristensen.com/).
