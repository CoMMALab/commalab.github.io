I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) with a concentration in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.

Prior to beginning graduate studies, I was a system engineer at Motorola Solutions' Upgrade Operations, performing system upgrades to critical radio infrastructure.

My research interests are targeted towards high performance system-level optimizations in order to make advanced robotics more viable. I am particularly interested in ways to leverage GPU hardware resources for accelerating sampling-based and learning-based robotics, and more generally integrating bleeding-edge computing paradigms into the domain of physical AI. In addition, I also aim to develop more robust tools tailored to effective hardware accelerated robotics research.

My broader interests in Computer Science include machine learning, system level software engineering, computational statistics and linear algebra, and GPU related IT infrastructure.
