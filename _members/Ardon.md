Hi, I'm Ardon. I'm currently a junior undergraduate CS major at Purdue. I am interested in AI/ML, robotics, and systems software. I also like it when the terminal prints a lot of text super fast. My deck is evo edrag and tesla, mighty miner, hog, goblin gang, ice spirit, log, and witch. I don't gamble.
