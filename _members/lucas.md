I am a Master's student at the CoMMA lab in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) of [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/).
Though it's too early to say for sure, my research interests include vision for robotics, physics informed networks, and motion planning, especially in wacky and unusual situations. In the past, I have worked with RL, language-controlled robots, and planning with PDEs.
I am also interested in how we can make proof-of-concept methods from literature reliable and explainable enough to deploy to commercial robots.
