I am a PhD student at CoMMA Lab, advised by Dr Zachary Kingston and Dr Aniket Bera, where I focus on Generative learning for Grasp and Motion Optimization. Before coming to Purdue, I worked at Pointivo, Inc., developing and deploying ML pipelines for 3D asset inspection. I did my Bachelors from UET Lahore and my Masters from LUMS.
