I am a first year PhD student at CoMMA lab, also joint advised by professor Lin Tan. My research interests span several areas across Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I hold a central curiosity for how intelligent systems can begin to replicate human adaptability in different environments. In particular, I am drawn to the fields of robotics and natural language processing. Both fields can be unified by a need for quick adaptation of general knowledge models, and I hope to develop scalable and efficient learning-based methods to address these limitations in real-world contexts. My long-term goal is to contribute to model distillation, few-shot, and novel methods in these fields that empower intelligent systems to adapt to new environments or tasks with limited resources.
