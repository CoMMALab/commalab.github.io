I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Zachary Kingston](https://commalab.org/members/kingston/) in the [CoMMA Lab](https://commalab.org/).

Prior to joining the CoMMA Lab, I completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. During my time at CMU, I worked in the [Search-based Planning Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/search-based-planning-laboratory/) from [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Maxim Likhachev](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/).

My research interests are in developing real-time robotic algorithms leveraging high-performance computing techniques. I am also interested in the decision and planning problems in robotics that require reasoning about physics and dynamics in the environment. I believe that providing solutions to these challenges is essential for robots to perform dexterous tasks in unstructured settings, such as domestic environments.
