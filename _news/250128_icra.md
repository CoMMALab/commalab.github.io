The CoMMA Lab will be presenting three papers at [ICRA 2025](https://2025.ieee-icra.org/)!

["Nearest-Neighbourless Asymptotically Optimal Motion Planning with Fully Connected Informed Trees (FCIT*)"](/publications#wilson2025fcit)
with Tyler Wilson, Jonathan Gammell, Wil Thomason, and Lydia E. Kavraki

This work opens new doors in almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning and shows with SIMD-accelerated edge validation and no nearest neighbors datastructure we can achieve real-time ASAO planning for high-dimensional manipulators!

["CaStL: Constraints as Specifications through LLM Translation for Long-Horizon Task and Motion Planning"](/publications#guo2025castl)
with Weihang Guo and Lydia E. Kavraki

This work presents an LLM-based natural language-to-specification framework that goes beyond goal reachability and can specify constraints such as action ordering, blocking, and more! We show using constraints is more effective than direct PDDL translation or task decomposition.

["Constrained Nonlinear Kaczmarz Projection on Intersections of Manifolds for Coordinated Multi-Robot Mobile Manipulation"](/publications#agrawal2025cnkz)
with Akshaya Agrawal, Parker Mayer, and Geoffrey Hollinger

This work presents a new method for finding valid configurations of multi-robot teams under complex non-linear constraints (e.g., as in collaborative transport) - handling systems where Newton-Raphson fails!
