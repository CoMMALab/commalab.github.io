The [Mechano-Computation for Expanding Scientific Horizons (MESH)](https://engineering.cmu.edu/mesh-rcn/index.html) Network has officially launched!
Together in collaboration with [Victoria Webster-Wood at CMU](https://engineering.cmu.edu/borg/index.html), [Nicholas Gravish at UCSD](http://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~ngravish/) and [Laura Blumenschein at Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=241064), this NSF-funded coordination network will support and foster new collaborations and bring together the community to advance research and impact in mechanical intelligence.

You can read more from [CMU's press office](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/news/2025/09/10-MESH.html) and the [official network website](https://engineering.cmu.edu/mesh-rcn/index.html).
