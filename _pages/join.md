# Joining the CoMMA Lab

We are always interested to hear from motivated undergradate and graduate researchers!
Please take a look at the [About page](/) and our [Research Areas](/projects) to see whether your background experiences, classwork, and interests align with the technical direction of the lab.

While not strictly required, it is recommended that you have experience in:
- Computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or a related field,
- Some domain of robotics (not only planning or manipulation),
- Programming in Python or C++, preferably both,
- Basic math courses, *e.g.*, calculus, linear algebra, multivariate calculus, statistics.

## Prospective Graduate Students

Please email the PI directly with your CV and a cover letter about why you are interested in working in the lab and your relevant experience.
You also must apply to the [Purdue Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/index.html).
Please note that all admission decisions are made by the admissions committee.

## Existing Purdue Undergraduate/Masters/Doctoral Students

Please email the PI directly with your résumé or CV and a cover letter about why you are interested in working in the lab and your relevant experience.

## Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to cultivating an environment in the CoMMA lab that is inclusive and welcoming to all. Embracing diversity in backgrounds and respecting all members enhances research and innovation and ensures a balanced perspective that mitigates unintended biases. As computer scientists shaping the future, it is our collective responsibility to collaborate in creating an equitable, inclusive, and inviting future for all.
