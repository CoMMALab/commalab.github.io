Please take a look at the [About page](/) and our [Research Areas](/projects) to see whether your background experiences, classwork, and interests align with the technical direction of the lab.

## Prospective Graduate Students

Please email the PI directly and apply to the [Purdue Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/index.html).

## Existing Purdue Undergraduate Students

Please email the PI directly with your résumé or CV and a brief paragraph about why you are interested in working in the lab.

While not strictly required, it is recommended that you have experience in:
- Some domain of robotics (not only planning or manipulation),
- Programming in Python or C++, preferably both,
- Basic math courses, *e.g.*, calculus, linear algebra, multivariate calculus, statistics.

## Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to cultivating an environment in the CoMMA lab that is inclusive and welcoming to all. Embracing diversity in backgrounds and respecting all members enhances research and innovation and ensures a balanced perspective that mitigates unintended biases. As computer scientists shaping the future, it is our collective responsibility to collaborate in creating an equitable, inclusive, and inviting future for all.
